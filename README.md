# howcani 🤖💭

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/howcani.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/howcani)

A CLI tool that translates your natural language questions into terminal commands using AI. Because remembering command syntax is hard, and asking for help should be easy.

> Fun fact: This tool was inspired by countless hours of Googling "how to tar a file" and "git revert last commit" over and over again. Now you can just ask! 🎯

## Examples

Here are some real questions and their answers:

```bash
howcani find all files modified in the last 24 hours
> find . -type f -mtime -1

howcani create a new branch and switch to it
> git checkout -b new-branch

howcani compress an entire directory
> tar -czf archive.tar.gz directory/

howcani find the process using port 3000
> lsof -i :3000
```

## Features

- 🤖 Uses OpenAI models to understand your questions (configurable model selection)
- 💡 Generates precise, executable commands
- 🌐 OS-aware command generation
- 🎨 Beautiful terminal output
- 🔑 Bring Your Own API Key - uses your OpenAI account
